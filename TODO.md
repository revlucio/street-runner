# TODO

- build a simple web host that renders the SVG X
    - extend this so you can choose osm files / gpx files

- crop the streets to just ones within the run box

- calculate which streets are covered by the run
    - basic unit tests with calculation X
    - highlight the roads with colours in svg X
    - improve complexity of 'covered' calculation

- BAM thats the MVP!

- add street names to the svg
- highlight streets as you hover
- hook into strava apis to download historical runs
- start to optimise this
- put it onto heroku
