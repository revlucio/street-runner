# TODO

- build a simple web host that renders the SVG X
    - extend this so you can choose osm files / gpx files

- crop the streets to just ones within the run box
- calculate which streets are covered by the run
    - basic unit tests with calculation
    - highlight the roads with colours in svg

- add street names to the svg
- highlight streets as you hover
- BAM thats the MVP!
