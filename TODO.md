# TODO

- basic UI using react
- improve performance with different levels of caching
- get e2e tests working against a docker instance
- get a bigger map file for london
- trim down the map file

- maybe convert the lat/lon into x/y to make svg and distance calc easier?
  prob dont need to take into account the curvature of the earth if its just london
  can then cache these x,y points instead of lat lon
